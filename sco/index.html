            <p><strong>The rapid decisionmaking and synchronization process is a technique that commanders and staffs commonly use during 
              execution.</strong>  While identified here with a specific name and method, the approach is not new; its use in the Army is well 
              established. Commanders and staffs develop this capability through training and practice.  When using this technique, the 
              following considerations apply:<ul><li>Rapid is often more important than process</li><li>Much of it may be mental rather 
              than written</li><li>It should become a battle drill for the current operations integration cells, future operations 
              cells, or both</li></ul></p>

              <p>While the military decisionmaking process (MDMP) seeks the optimal solution (see chapter 9), the rapid decisionmaking 
                and synchronization process seeks a timely and effective solution within the commander&rsquo;s intent, mission, and concept of 
                operations.  Using the rapid decisionmaking and synchronization process lets leaders avoid the time&ndash;consuming 
                requirements of developing decision criteria and comparing courses of action (COAs).  Operational and mission variables 
                continually change during execution.  This often invalidates or weakens COAs and decision criteria before leaders can 
                make a decision.  Under the rapid decisionmaking and synchronization process, leaders combine their experience and 
                intuition to quickly reach situational understanding.  Based on this, they develop and refine workable COAs.<br>Ref: FM

                  decisions during execution:<ul><li>It is comprehensive, integrating all warfighting functions. It is not limited to 
                  any one warfighting function</li><li>It ensures all actions support the decisive operation by relating them to the 
                  commander&rsquo;s intent and concept of operations</li><li>It allows rapid changes to the order or mission</li><li>It is

            <p>Ref: FM 6&ndash;0, para 14&ndash;12</p>
            <p>The rapid decisionmaking and synchronization process is based on an existing order and the commander&rsquo;s priorities as 
              expressed in the order.  The most important of these control measures are the commander&rsquo;s intent, concept of operations, 
              and commander&rsquo;s critical information requirements (CCIRs).  <strong>The rapid decisionmaking and synchronization process includes 
              five steps.</strong>  The first two may be performed in any order, including concurrently.  The last three are performed 
              interactively until commanders identify an acceptable course of action. (See figure 14&ndash;1.)</p>

              <p>When a variance is identified, the commander directs action while the chief of operations leads chiefs of the current 
                operations integration cell and selected functional cells in quickly comparing the current situation to the expected

              <p>Commanders and staffs identify likely variances during planning and identify options that will be present and actions that 
                will be available when each variance occurs.  <strong>During execution, commanders and staffs monitor the situation to identify 
                changes in conditions.</strong>  Then they ask if these changes affect the overall conduct of operations or their part in them and 
                if the changes are significant. Finally, they identify if the changed conditions represent variances from the order&mdash;especially 
                opportunities and risks. Staff members use running estimates to look for indicators of variances that affect their areas of 
                expertise.<br>Ref: FM 6&ndash;0, para 14&ndash;13</p>
              <p><strong>Staff members are particularly alert for answers to CCIRs that support anticipated decisions.</strong>  They also watch for 
                exceptional information&ndash;information that would have answered one of the CCIRs if the requirement for it had been foreseen 
                and stated as one of the CCIRs.  Exceptional information usually reveals a need for an adjustment decision.<br>Ref: FM 6&ndash;0, para 14&ndash;14</p>
              <p><strong>When performing the rapid decisionmaking and synchronization process, the current operations integration cell first 
                compares the current situation to the one envisioned in the order.</strong>  It may obtain assistance from the assessment section or 
                the red team section in this analysis.  If the situation requires greater analysis, the chief of staff or executive officer 
                (COS [XO]) may task the future operations cell (where authorized) or the plans cell to perform this analysis.  At echelons 
                with no future operations cell, the plans cell or the current operations integration cell performs this function.<br>Ref: FM 6&ndash;0, para 14&ndash;15</p>

            <p>Determine if a new course of action should be developed.</p>
            <p>When a variance is identified, the commander directs action while the chief of operations leads chiefs of the current 
              operations integration cell and selected functional cells in quickly comparing the current situation to the expected 
              situation.  This assessment accomplishes the following:<ul><li>Describes the variance</li><li>Determines if the variance 
              provides a significant opportunity or threat and examines the potential of either</li><li>Determines if a decision is 
              needed by identifying if the variance:<ul><li>Indicates an opportunity that can be exploited to accomplish the mission 
              faster or with fewer resources</li><li>Directly threatens the decisive operation’s success</li><li>Threatens a shaping 
              operation such that it may threaten the decisive operation directly or in the near future</li><li>Can be addressed 
              within the commander’s intent and concept of operations &ndash; if so, determine what execution decision is needed</li>
              <li>Requires changing the concept of operations substantially - if so, determine what adjustment decision or new approach 
              will best suit the circumstances</li></ul></li></ul></p>
            <p>For minor variances, the chief of operations works with other cell chiefs to determine whether changes to control 
              measures are needed.  If so, they determine how those changes affect other warfighting functions.  They direct changes 
              within their authority (execution decisions) and notify the COS (XO) and the affected command post cells and staff 
              elements.<br>Ref: FM 6&ndash;0, para 14&ndash;17</p>
            <p>Commanders intervene directly in cases that affect the overall direction of the unit.  They describe the situation, 
              direct their subordinates to provide any additional information they need, and order either implementation of planned

            <h3>Course of Action Explained</h3>
            <hr>
            <p><strong>The new options must conform to the commander&rsquo;s intent.</strong>   Possible COAs may alter the concept of operations and CCIRs, if 
              they remain within the commander&rsquo;s intent.  However, the commander approves changes to the CCIRs.  Functional cell chiefs 
              and other staff leaders identify areas that may be affected within their areas of expertise by proposed changes to the 
              order or mission.  Course of action considerations include, but are not limited to, those shown in table 14&ndash;3.
              <br>Ref: FM 6&ndash;0, para 14&ndash;20</p>
            <p>The commander is as likely as anyone else to detect the need for change and to sketch out the options.  Whether the 
              commander, COS (XO), or chief of operations does this, the future operations cell is often directed to further develop 
              the concept and draft the order.  The chief of operations and the current operations integration cell normally lead this 
              effort, especially if the response is needed promptly or the situation is not complex.  <strong>The commander or COS (XO) is 
              usually the decisionmaking authority, depending on the commander&rsquo;s delegation of authority.</strong>
              <br>Ref: FM 6&ndash;0, para 14&ndash;21</p>
            <p>Commanders may delegate authority for execution decisions to their deputies, COSs (XOs), or their operations officers.  
              They retain personal responsibility for all decisions and normally retain the authority for approving adjustment decisions.
              <br>Ref: FM 6&ndash;0, para 14&ndash;22</p>
            <p>When reallocating resources or priorities, commanders assign only minimum essential assets to shaping operations. They 
              use all other assets to weight the decisive operation.  This applies when allocating resources for the overall operation 
              or within a warfighting function.
              <br>Ref: FM 6&ndash;0, para 14&ndash;23</p>
            <p>Commanders normally direct the future operations cell or the current operations integration cell to prepare a fragmentary 
              order (FRAGORD) setting conditions for executing a new COA.  <strong>When lacking time to perform the MDMP, or quickness of action 
              is desirable, commanders make an immediate adjustment decision&mdash;using intuitive decisionmaking&mdash;in the form of a focused COA.</strong> 
              Developing the focused COA often follows mental war&ndash;gaming by commanders until they reach an acceptable COA.  If time is 
              available, commanders may direct the plans cell to develop a new COA using the MDMP, and the considerations for planning 
              become operative.

            <h3>Refine and Validate the Course of Action</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Once commanders describe the new COA, the current operations integration cell conducts an analysis to validate its 
              feasibility, suitability, and acceptability.  If acceptable, the COA is refined to resynchronize the warfighting functions 
              enough to generate and apply the needed combat power. Staffs with a future operations cell may assign that cell responsibility 
              for developing the details of the new COA and drafting a fragmentary order to implement it.  <strong>The commander or COS (XO) may 
              direct an &ldquo;on&ndash;call&rdquo; operations synchronization meeting to perform this task and ensure rapid resynchronization.</strong>
              <br>Ref: FM 6&ndash;0, para 14&ndash;25</p>
            <p>Validation and refinement are done quickly. Normally, the commander and staff officers conduct a mental war game of the 
              new COA.  They consider potential enemy reactions, the unit&rsquo;s counteractions, and secondary effects that might affect the 
              force&rsquo;s synchronization.  Each staff member considers the following items:<ul><li>Is the new COA feasible in terms of 
              my area of expertise?</li><li>How will this action affect my area of expertise?</li><li>Does it require changing my 
              information requirements?<ul><li>Should any of the information requirements be nominated as a CCIR?</li><li>What actions 
              within my area of expertise does this change require?</li><li>Will this COA require changing objectives or targets 
              nominated by staff members?</li></ul></li><ul><li>What other command post cells and elements does this action 
              affect?</li><li>What are potential enemy reactions?</li><li>What are the possible friendly counteractions?<ul><li>Does 
              this counteraction affect my area of expertise?</li><li>Will it require changing my information requirements?</li><li>Are 
              any of my information requirements potential CCIRs?</li><li>What actions within my area of expertise does this 
              counteraction require?</li><li>Will it require changing objectives or targets nominated by staff members?</li><li>What 
              other command post cells and elements does this counteraction affect?</li></ul></li></ul><br>Ref: FM 6&ndash;0, para 14&ndash;26</p>
            <p><strong>The validation and refinement will show if the COA will solve the problem adequately.</strong>  If it does not, the COS or chief 
              of operations modifies it through additional analysis or develops a new COA.  The COS (XO) informs the commander of any 
              changes made to the COA.

              <h3>Implement</h3>
              <hr>
              <p>When a COA is acceptable, the COS (XO) recommends implementation to the commander or implements it directly, if the 
                commander has delegated that authority.  <strong>Implementation normally requires a FRAGORD; in exceptional circumstances, it 
                may require a new operation order (OPORD).  That order changes the concept of operations (in adjustment decisions), 
                resynchronizes the warfighting functions, and disseminates changes to control measures.  The staff uses warning orders 
                (WARNORDs) to alert subordinates to a pending change.  The staff also establishes sufficient time for the unit to 
                implement the change without losing integration or being exposed to unnecessary tactical risk.</strong>
                <br>FM 6&ndash;0, para 14&ndash;28</p>
              <p>Commanders often issue orders to subordinates verbally in situations requiring quick reactions.  At battalion and 
                higher echelons, written FRAGORDs confirm verbal orders to ensure synchronization, integration, and notification of all 
                parts of the force.  If time permits, leaders verify that subordinates understand critical tasks.  Verification methods 
                include the confirmation brief and backbrief.  These are conducted both between commanders and within staff elements to 
                ensure mutual understanding.
                <br>FM 6&ndash;0, para 14&ndash;29</p>
              <p><strong>After the analysis is complete, the current operations integration cell and command post cell chiefs update decision 
                support templates and synchronization matrixes.</strong>  When time is available, the operations officer or chief of operations 
                continues this analysis to the operation&rsquo;s end to complete combat power integration.  Staff members begin the 
                synchronization needed to implement the decision.  This synchronization involves collaboration with other command post 
                cells and subordinate staffs.  Staff members determine how actions in their areas of expertise affect others.  They 
                coordinate those actions to eliminate undesired effects that might cause friction.  The cells provide results of this 
                synchronization to the current operations integration cell and the common operational picture.

            <p>In this lesson, we discussed the rapid decisionmaking and synchronization process.  We started RDSP with the current 
              situation.  Next, we discussed the type of decision required.  From there we moved on to course of action.  Refine and 
              validate the course of action followed.  Finally, we covered Implement.  This lesson provided you with an opportunity to 
              work through the RDSP that you may not have been previously exposed to.</p>
